= yaml_config_file

Generate a YAML configuration file for a Rails 3 application, and an
initializer that loads the configuration file.

For example:

  rails generate yaml_config_file app_config

This will generate a YAML configuration file in config/app_config.yml, and
an initializer in config/initializers/app_config.rb to load it.
